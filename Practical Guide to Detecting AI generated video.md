### Practical Guide to Detecting AI generated video

#### 1. Look for Visual Irregularities
Even advanced AI models sometimes struggle with small details.
* Face & Body

* Strange or inconsistent blinking

* Odd lighting on the face compared to the environment

* Awkward or stiff head movements

* Unnatural skin texture (too smooth, too shiny, or inconsistently detailed)

** Background

* Warped objects or buildings

* Inconsistent shadows

* Blurry items that should be in focus

* Background elements that shift or “swim” unnaturally

** Motion
* Hands or fingers that distort

* Clothing that flickers or merges with the skin

* Lips slightly out of sync with spoken words


#### 2. Listen for Audio Clues
AI-generated voices often contain subtle auditory errors.
* Emotion that feels flat, inconsistent, or misplaced

* Strange pacing (too fast, too slow, uneven rhythm)

* Inconsistent background noise

* Words that fade or glitch at the start or end of sentences


#### 3. Check Context & Content
Sometimes the content itself is the biggest giveaway.
Ask Yourself:

* Does this person normally speak or behave this way?

* Did the video come from a trustworthy source?

* Is it unusually shocking, emotional, or “too perfect”?
    * AI videos often target emotional reactions.

#### 4. Verify the Source
Before sharing or believing a video, confirm where it comes from.

* Look for the original uploader

* See if reputable news outlets or official channels posted it

* Reverse-search key frames (screenshots) to find earlier versions

* Check comments—others may have already identified issues

#### 5. Look for Technical Artifacts
AI systems sometimes leave behind subtle signatures.

* Frame-by-frame flickering

* Sudden changes in lighting or color grading

* Edges around the face that look “cut out" or too sharp

* Unusual compression patterns


You can pause the video and slowly scrub through it to spot these.

#### 6. Use Detection Tools When Needed
Several online tools can help spot manipulated media, analyzing things like shadows, artifacts, and metadata. (Be cautious with services that request uploads of personal videos.)

#### 7. When in Doubt, Don’t Spread It
If a video seems suspicious or too dramatic, it’s safer not to share it. False videos can cause real harm.
